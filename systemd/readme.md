# Installation

1. the required python packages should be available in the context of the *tablet-vinsa1060* service. On Fedora it is enough to install `python3-evdev`, `python3-pyusb` and `python3-pyyaml`
1. the makefile expects that the `10moons-probe` utility (`https://github.com/DIGImend/10moons-tools`) is available in `../../10moons-tools/10moons-probe`
1. ```sudo make install```
